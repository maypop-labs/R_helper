# R_helper README

If your system does not already have **RTools** installed, you will need to install **RTools** before you run any of these scripts.  

1. First, find the **RTools** version that is appropriate for your version of R. You can download **RTools** [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
2. Once the **RTools** installer has downloaded, you will need to temporarily disable **Windows Defender**. I know this sounds like I'm asking you to install malware, but just trust me. Once the process has finished, you will turn **Windows Defender** back on. To disable **Windows Defender**:
	- Open **Windows Security** > **Virus & threat protection** > **Manage settings** > Temporarily turn off **Real-time protection.**
3. Right-click on the downloaded **RTools** installer file and click **Run as administrator**
4. Use all the **RTools** Default settings.
5. Once installation has finished, turn on **Windows Defender Real-time protection.**
